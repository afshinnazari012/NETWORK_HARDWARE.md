## üñß What is Network Hardware?

Network hardware consists of physical devices required for communication and interconnection between computers, servers, and other endpoints. These devices facilitate data transmission, control network traffic, and enforce communication protocols.

## üîå Core Network Devices

### 1. **Router**
- Connects multiple networks together (e.g., LAN to WAN)
- Performs packet forwarding based on IP addresses
- Often includes NAT, DHCP, and firewall features
- Supports static or dynamic routing (e.g., OSPF, BGP)

### 2. **Switch**
- Operates at Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)
- Forwards frames based on MAC addresses
- Supports VLANs, port security, trunking
- Managed vs unmanaged switches

### 3. **Hub** *(Legacy)*
- Broadcasts data to all connected devices
- No intelligence or filtering
- Replaced by switches due to inefficiency

### 4. **Access Point (AP)**
- Provides wireless connectivity (Wi-Fi) to clients
- Connects to a wired switch or router
- May support WPA3, MU-MIMO, mesh topology

### 5. **Firewall Appliance**
- Hardware-based firewall for deep inspection
- May include IDS/IPS capabilities
- Often used in perimeter security or DMZs

## üè≠ Enterprise-Grade Hardware

### 1. **Core Router**
- High-performance, handles large amounts of traffic
- Used in data centers and ISPs
- Supports MPLS, QoS, BGP, redundant paths

### 2. **Layer 3 Switch**
- Combines switching and basic routing
- Faster than traditional routers for intra-network routing

### 3. **Load Balancer**
- Distributes traffic across multiple servers
- Supports Layer 4 (TCP) and Layer 7 (HTTP) balancing
- Hardware (e.g., F5 BIG-IP) or software-based (e.g., HAProxy)

### 4. **Network TAP**
- Passive device used to monitor traffic without disruption
- Common in security monitoring and forensics

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Concepts in Network Hardware Design

- **Redundancy** (e.g., dual routers, dual NICs)
- **Throughput vs Latency trade-offs**
- **Uplink vs Downlink capacity**
- **Rack-mount vs Desktop form factors**
- **Power and cooling considerations in datacenters**

---

## üîê Security in Network Hardware

- Hardware firewalls (e.g., Fortinet, Palo Alto)
- Port-level security on switches (802.1X)
- Network Access Control (NAC) enforcement
- Physical security: locked racks, tamper-evident seals

---

## üìà Performance Monitoring Tools

- SNMP Monitoring (e.g., via LibreNMS, PRTG)
- NetFlow / sFlow collectors
- CLI-based tools (`show interfaces`, `traceroute`, `ping`)

---

## üß† Best Practices

- Label all hardware and cabling
- Use managed switches for visibility and control
- Deploy redundant power supplies and dual NICs in servers
- Regularly update firmware for routers/switches
